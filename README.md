##What Is Urban Applause

Urban Applause lets you track street artists. You can use it to find awesome art in your neighbourhood, or to track your favorite artists as they move between cities.

##How It Works

Anyone can upload to Urban Applause. Whether or not you know who the artist is, add photos of great street art you find here. If you do know the artist, you can create a new profile for them.
